    Hi! My name is Claire McManus and I am sophomore IT student at Mizzou. I am from St. Louis and Iâ€™m in a sorority at Mizzou. In my free time I like to hangout with my friends and be outside. I took a web application class and a database systems class last semester, so I have experience creating webpages with HTML and Python. I expect to deepen my skills in this course and hopefully be more advanced in web development. This class will help me to realize if I am interested in web development and if it is something I could see myself doing in the future.
