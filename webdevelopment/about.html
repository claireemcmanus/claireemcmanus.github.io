        <p>I am from St. Louis, Missouri and I went to Cor Jesu Academy. I am currently on the second semester of my sophomore year at the University of Missouri. I am working towards a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the College of Engineering. I am on the path to obtain certificates in Cybersecurity, Web and App Development, Information Systems and Technology, and Media Technology and Design. I am sufficient in Python, HTML, C#, and C++. I also have experience with Microsoft office and Adobe Creative Cloud. I have made the High Dean’s List 3/3 semesters in the College of Engineering. I am expected to graduate in May of 2027.</p>
