        <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am Claire McManus, a sophomore at the University of Missouri! </p>
    
        <h2>Website Purpose</h2>
        <p>This website is created to show my professional skills, accomplishments, and experiences. I will be providing an organized view of my journey at Mizzou so far, while highlighting key projects and skills I have acquired. Designed to engage potential employers, this platform provides valuable insight into my capabilities and how they align with organizational goals. By creating an accessible and visually appealing representation of my personal brand, I aim to connect with industry professionals and demonstrate how my skills can contribute to their success. Information technology is a broad major, as I have learned skills in multiple coding languages, cybersecurity, and media design. I hope by showcasing my projects in these different sectors, I can widen my career opportunities and appeal to a diverse range of industries. This portfolio reflects my dedication to continuous learning and my ability to adapt to various challenges within the field of information technology, making me a valuable asset to any organization.</p>
