                <p>At Mizzou, I am working on expanding my knowledge of Information Technology and finding my true passion. I have taken many different types of classes that has helped me to determine what I see myself doing in the future. My love for continuous learning pushes me to keep working hard and trying my best with everything I do. 

                    The technical classes I have taken include cybersecurity, network typology, media design, and artificial intelligence. I have also taken a variety of coding classes in different languages. I am familiar with python, C#, HTML, C++, and more. 
                    
                </p>
                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, my career goals are unclear, but I know that I will try my hardest in whatever I decide to do. I am a hard worker who will leverage my technical expertise to make meaningful contributions to organizations. I am particularly drawn to roles that allow me to develop creative solutions while addressing critical challenges.
                    
                    Through this reflection and philosophy, I aim to show my dedication to both personal and professional growth while contributing positively to the fields I am passionate about.
