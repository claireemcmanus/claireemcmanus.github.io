                <p>At Mizzou, I am working on expanding my knowledge of Information Technology.
                    I am also in the process of finding my true passion within the field.
                    I have taken many different types of classes that have helped me determine what I see myself doing in the future.
                    These courses have exposed me to a wide variety of skills and ideas.
                    My love for continuous learning pushes me to keep working hard every day.
                    I always try my best in everything I do, both inside and outside of the classroom.
                    I am motivated by the opportunity to grow and improve through each experience.
                    The technical classes I have taken include cybersecurity, network topology, media design, and artificial intelligence.
                    Each class has expanded my understanding of the complex world of Information Technology.
                    In addition to technical knowledge, I have completed a variety of coding classes in different programming languages.
                    I am familiar with Python, C#, HTML, C++, and several other languages.
                    These skills have given me a strong foundation across multiple areas of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, my career goals are still taking shape as I explore different options.
                    Although I am uncertain of the exact path, I know that I will give my best effort in whatever I decide to pursue.
                    I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who plans to use my technical expertise to make meaningful contributions.
                    I am particularly drawn to roles that allow me to develop creative solutions to critical challenges.
                    Through this reflection, I want to demonstrate my strong commitment to personal growth.
                    I am equally dedicated to achieving professional success in whatever field I enter.
                    Continuous learning will always be a core part of my career and personal philosophy.
                    Wherever my future may lead me, I am determined to contribute positively and make a difference.
